# Connect4_AI
This project is a Connect4 basic engine that includes an AI algorithm that plays against person. It has a similar structure as the chess AI

## Documentation
 - It has a recurrent algorithm that see the different combinations and has a maximum depth of 8 moves.
 - It is written in C++ and Python, I have made a user interface for the client

## Performance
 - [website](http://dprogrammer.org/connect-4) - dProgrammer's website where I explain the basics
 - It performs well, human-level and sometimes overperforming.
 
 ## Next steps
 - Parallel computing
 - Optimize algorithm
 - Convolutional neural network vs Recurrent algorithm
 - implementation of complex algorithm
 - different search algorithms (Min-max searching, alpha-beta pruning, null move heuristic, quiescence searching, etc), better than brute force search
